              Hey! I&apos;m Samuel, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. I
              specialize in the front-end, primarily Javascript and React, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              In this fast-paced digital landscape, staying current with the
              latest technologies is a priority for me. I&apos;m a firm believer
              in lifelong learning, always eager to explore new tools,
              frameworks, and techniques. By keeping my skills up-to-date, I
              ensure that I can provide innovative solutions to the challenges
              of today&apos;s digital world..

              Outside of work, I harbor a passion for cinematography. While
              I&apos;m busy crafting digital landscapes, I also enjoy capturing
              moments through the lens of a camera. Whether it&apos;s the play
              of light and shadow or the art of storytelling, cinematography
              allows me to express my creativity in a different form. It&apos;s
              not just about capturing visuals; it&apos;s about evoking emotions
              and telling stories that resonate.

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
              love for code with my love for cinematography. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
