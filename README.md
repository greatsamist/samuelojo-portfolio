## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project showcases my skills as a frontend developer and my passion for creating captivating web experiences. The portfolio is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for efficient and dynamic web development, [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static typing, [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for animations, and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for interactive animations.
